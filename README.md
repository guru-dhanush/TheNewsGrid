# The News Grid

## Overview
This application is a frontend implementation for a news aggregator website, allowing users to customize and explore news articles from multiple sources in a clean and mobile-responsive interface. The application is built using React.js and utilizes three APIs to fetch news data: The Guardian, The New York Times, and NewsAPI.org.

## Features

### 1. Article Search and Filtering
- Users can search for articles by keywords with a 1-second debounce to optimize performance.
- Filter search results by date range, category, or source using a dynamic filter panel.

### 2. Personalized News Feed
- Users can select their preferred news sources, categories, and authors via a preferences panel.
- Preferences are saved in local storage and applied across sessions.
- Ability to reset individual preferences or all preferences at once.

### 3. Mobile-Responsive Design
- The application is fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on any screen size.

### 4. Dark/Light Mode
- The application supports dark and light themes for enhanced user accessibility.
- Users can toggle between dark and light modes, and their preference is saved in local storage.

### 5. News Display
- Headlines are shown in a slider carousel. Clicking a headline redirects the user to the full article in a new tab.
- A discover section displays news articles in cards with a "Read More" button to access the full story.

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up API keys:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your API keys for The Guardian, The New York Times, and NewsAPI.org:
     ```env
     VITE_APP_GUARDIAN_API_KEY=<your_guardian_api_key>
     VITE_APP_NYT_API_KEY=<your_nyt_api_key>
     VITE_APP_NEWSAPI_KEY=<your_newsapi_key>
     ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

##  Issues I faced during the assignment
-I came across a number of issues and questions while developing this assignment.

1. **Limited Data Sources**:
   Below three apis had clear documentation and easy to implement  
   - **NewsAPI**
   - **The Guardian**
   - **New York Times**
   
   Below apis had some challenges such has no clear documentation or lacked reliable resources
   - **Open News**
   - **Newscred**
   - **BBC News**

2. **Filter by Author**:
   - After extensive searches, I discovered that filtering by author was not directly supported in the APIs used (Guardian API, News API, and NY Times API). Hence, as a workaround implemented frontend filtering with fetched data.

3. **Dynamic Query Handling**:
   - Each API had distinct query parameters, requiring dynamic API calls and data normalization. Hence constructed dynamic query for these APIs.

4. **Category and Source Filtering**:
   - APIs like NewsAPI, The Guardian, and NY Times had different implementations for filtering by category and sources, which needed to be unified dynamically for consistent results.

5. **Rate Limits**:
   - Developer APIs had a limit of 100 calls per day, which added some constraints on testing and development flexibility.
